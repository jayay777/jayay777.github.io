5 Minute Raid is a new take on the previous project Dimension Guard; an indie game project made by myself and 3 others.
Our team decided it is a waste to simply let go of this fresh idea and let it be forgotten as a university project.

The general idea is the same; 3 heros team up together against another player, who takes the role of the raid boss.

The viewpoint has changed from a side-scroll platformer to a top-down view in order to diversify the gameplay.
The original Dimension Guards had a problem that the platformer aspect restricted the movement and tactics too much, and thus while this did make the gameplay did feel casual, there weren't a lot of viable options to give it some depth.

Below is a very early development build test gameplay that was played with the 4 team members. There were many visual bugs yet to be fixed, but most of the gameplay bugs were fixed by this point.

- 12 different perks for Guardians: 3 can be selected to customize the character according to the play style.
- 2 different Bosses with completely different skill set
- A "Phase" system where the boss becomes stronger when their HP drop below 60% and 30%.
- 6 different perks for Bosses, 3 can be selected per game. One for each phase.
- Randomly generated map gimmicks system with 5 different gimmicks so far. 3 are selected for each game.
- Cross-platform gameplay across PC and mobile.
