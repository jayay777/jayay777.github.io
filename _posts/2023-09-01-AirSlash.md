AirSlash! is a mini project that I spent about 3 days on. It is a command-input based action game with a vampire survivor like system of upgrading or acquiring new skills and defeating enemies. Each enemy has a red hp bar, and a white guard bar. The enemy becomes stunned once the guard bar becomes 0. The player can then start a combo to damage the enemy. The enemy cannot start moving and attacking before they reach the ground again. 

To put it short, it is a rogue-like action platformer that uses Tekken-like command input & combo system. 

# Features

* Guard bar and guard break system.
* Modulized skill acquisition & upgrade system
* Procedural scale-down on attack lifting force for preventing infinite-combos
