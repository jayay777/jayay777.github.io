Dimension Guard is an indie game project made by myself and 3 others.
This was the first time the four of us had made a multiplayer game, but we are proud with the result. The game is about a 3d monster that has invaded the 2d dimensions, and the heroes that have gathered from each 2d dimension to defeat the monster; hence the name Dimension Guards.

I've took the role of director and programmer, designating who does what, and merging the branches together after a week of scrum.
