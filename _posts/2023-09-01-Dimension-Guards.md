**Dimension Guards** was a university indie game project created by myself and three teammates.  
It was the first time any of us had developed a multiplayer title—and despite the steep learning curve, we were proud of the final result.

---

## Concept
The game features a **1 vs 3 asymmetrical PvP** setup.  
A powerful **3D monster** invades multiple **2D worlds**, and heroes from each dimension join forces to defeat it—hence the name *Dimension Guards*.

---

## My Role
I served as **Director** and **Programmer**, responsible for:
- Assigning tasks and organizing weekly Scrum meetings
- Merging branches after each sprint
- Implementing major systems, including:

  - Login & Lobby systems
  - Player and match statistics
  - Backend communication and synchronization
  - Intro cutscene
  - Main menu UI
- Debugging and troubleshooting across all modules

We followed **Agile Scrum methodology**, completing the project in **8 weekly sprints**.

## Development Process
After each sprint:
1. We merged all completed work.
2. Collected feedback and identified issues.
3. Assigned new tasks for the next sprint.

This project directly inspired our next, more refined game: **[5 Minute Raid](/5MinuteRaid)**.

## Main Features
- **Boss Role (1 Player)**  
  Controls attacks using mouse input to queue skills, targeting the heroes.

## Lessons Learned
**Dimension Guards** was my first hands-on experience with:
- Building a multiplayer game from the ground up in Unity
- Managing a small development team using Agile Scrum
- Handling version control and resolving merge conflicts in a collaborative setting

This project taught me not only the technical skills behind multiplayer game programming but also the importance of **clear communication, role assignment, and iterative development**.  
It laid the foundation for my leadership style and directly influenced the design and scope of
[**5 Minute Raid**](/blog/5_Minute_Raid).
