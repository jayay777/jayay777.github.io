**5 Minute Raid** is a modern reimagining of [*Dimension Guards*](/blog/Dimension-Guards), an indie project I originally developed with three other teammates during university.

I served as **director** and **lead client programmer**, while the other members took on roles as:
- Client Programmer
- UI Designer & Game Systems Designer
- AWS Backend Programmer & Database Analyst

After graduation, we felt it would be a waste to let such a unique concept fade away as just a school project—so we decided to rebuild and expand it into a fully realized game.

## From Dimension Guards to 5 Minute Raid
The core idea remained: three heroes team up to battle a fourth player controlling a raid boss.  
However, we made major changes to improve depth and replayability:

- **Viewpoint Shift** – We moved from a side-scrolling platformer to a **top-down view**. The original format restricted movement and tactics, which made the gameplay casual but limited in strategic options.
- **Tactical Depth** – The new perspective opened up more room for map variety, skill interactions, and unique class mechanics.
- **Rogue-like** – For better replayability and depth, Guardians can level up by defeating mobs, unlocking stronger abilities synergizing their abilities with others.

## Unique Gameplay Features
One early test video below shows our approach to class abilities.  
In the clip below, the *Shielder* class uses their **Taunt** skill. Since the boss is also a player, Taunt works by forcing the boss’s screen to display only the Shielder for the skill’s duration—allowing allies like the Magician or Ranger to safely deliver heavy damage.

## IndieCraft Exhibition
During development, we connected with publishers and fellow developers while preparing for [**IndieCraft**](https://www.snip.or.kr/indiecraft/contents/idcrft-2024.do?schM=view&page=1&viewCount=999&id=17407&schBdcode=2024&schGroupCode=){:target="blank"}, an indie game showcase.

After the exhibition, we introduced a **rogue-like leveling system** to deepen the gameplay. Guardians can level up by defeating periodically spawning mobs, unlocking stronger abilities and customizing their build for different strategies.

## Reflection
There’s still room to grow—but this project taught our team invaluable lessons in **teamwork, project management, and end-to-end game development**.  
For me, it was not just about programming—it was about understanding every stage of building and releasing a game.  
**5 Minute Raid** stands as a proud milestone and a foundation for even bigger projects ahead.
