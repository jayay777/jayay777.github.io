CatGPT is a project to create a pet simulator that utilizes Unity for the frontend, and Spring & OpenAI API for the backend.

The overall application procedure is as follows:

1. The user inputs an action or speech(Saying "Hi!" or filling the food bowl)
2. The input is handed over to the OpenAI API
3. GPT-2.5 generates an appropriate response(ex. Running over to the food bowl while saying "Yay!")
4. The tokenized, is then sent over to Unity, which then shows the action and the speech bubble.
