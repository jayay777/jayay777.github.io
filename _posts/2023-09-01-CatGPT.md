CatGPT is a project to create a pet simulator that that utilizes Unity for frontend, Spring and OpenAI API for backend.

The overall application procedure is as follows:

1. The user inputs an action or speech(Saying "Hi!" or filling the food bowl)
2. The input is handed over to the OpenAI API
3. GPT-2.5 generates an appropriate response(ex. Running over to the food bowl while saying "Yay!")
4. The tokenized, then sent over to Unity, which then shows the action and the speech bubble.
