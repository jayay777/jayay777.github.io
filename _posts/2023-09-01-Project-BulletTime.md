Project BulletTime is a private project I've been working on, bit by bit ever since I started Unity. To put it simply, it is a mix of Slay the Spire and XCom. The player uses cards to defeat enemies, and aquire more cards or upgrade them to go forward. The twist is that <b>time</b> is also a resource. Each card uses a certain amount of time unless it is used with a cancel mode. You can also say that it is a strategetic real-time action game that is mixed up with Slay the Spire.
	
# Features I have implemented.

Aside from the 3d models, illustrations and some of the music, everything has been done by myself. Including:

* The idea and the game system.

* The 50+ cards that has been implemented, and their upgrades

* UI & their animations

* The black market & workshop
